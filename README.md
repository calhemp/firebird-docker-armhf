## Events
Please note for events to work properly you must either configure RemoteAuxPort and forward it with -p using a direct mapping where both sides internal and external use the same port or use --net=host to allow the random port mapping to work.
see: http://www.firebirdfaq.org/faq53/ for more information on event port mapping.

# run
I run this container with a shared folder that have my database.fdb
```
docker run -d -p 3050:3050 -v /my/folder/database/path:/databases nameofimage
```
or run container with availableÂ host port run with -P prefix and docker will do the rest, se what port is used with docker ps or docker inspect.
```
docker run -d -P -v /my/folder/database/path:/databases nameofimage
