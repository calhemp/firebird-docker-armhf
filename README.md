# build and run
```
git clone https://github.com/calhemp/firebird-docker-armhf.git
cd firebird-docker-armhf
*build example:
sudo docker build -t mybuild/firebird-server-arm .
```
I run this container with a shared folder that have my database.fdb or create a database with /usr/local/firbird/isql in /database volume folder inside container.
```
docker run -d -p 3050:3050 -v /my/folder/database/path:/databases mybuild/firebird-server-arm
```
or run container with availableÂ host port run with -P prefix and docker will do the rest, se what port is used with docker ps or docker inspect.
```
docker run -d -P -v /my/folder/database/path:/databases mybuild/firebird-server-arm
```
